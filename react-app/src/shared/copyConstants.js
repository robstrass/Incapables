  a look at some of the incapables already written on the site
  to get a feel for how things are written. Those will give you
  a good idea for how to create a good incapable.

  With so many incapables being created on the site all the time,
  you should have plenty of ideas on what to do to get started on
  your very own incapable.`,

  HOW_TO_WRITE_INCAPABLE_PARAGRAPH_1: `To start a new Incapable, go to the Publish button in the main
  navigation bar at the top of the site. Once there, click "Log In"
  or "Sign Up" if you don't have an account. You need to be a member of Incapables to author your own
  Incapable. If you aren't already a member, feel free to sign up
  and join the community. It's 100% free to join`,
  HOW_TO_WRITE_INCAPABLE_PARAGRAPH_2: `Once you begin your Incapable, the first step is to name it.
  You'll want your name to be simple, clear, and descriptive so
  others will be able to identify exactly what your Incapable is
  about. Next, you'll want to give your incapable a brief description so
  community members can see what your project is about. This will
  help others get an idea of what your incapable does. Finally, you'll want to select a topic category for your
  incapable. Categories help other members of the community find
  incapables that they're interested in. Each project can only have
  one category, so choose the category that best fits your
  incapable.`,
  HOW_TO_WRITE_INCAPABLE_PARAGRAPH_3: `After you've finished with those first steps, just press "Start
  Incapable", and you'll be well on your way to creating your first
  Incapable! Congratulations, and welcome to the Incapables
  community.`,

  OUR_STORY_PARAGRAPH: `Incapables was created by Rob Strasser as a spinoff of the popular DIY website
  Instructables, where users can create step by step guides for activities, crafts,
  hobbies, etc. Instead of making a direct clone, Rob wanted to key into his sarcastic
  sense of humor and make this the opposite -- instead of helpful DIY guides,
  Incapables serves as an anti guide, purposely, sometimes even hyperbolically,
  incorrect instructions for said activities.

  Incapables served as Rob's capstone project, marking the completion of his 6-month immersive
  web development bootcamp. In this fullstack project, Rob utilized all the skills and knowledge
  he picked up, both from working on other solo projects, and collaborating with colleagues.
  This project utilizes a React and JavaScript front end, with Redux for state storage, and a
  backend written in Python, with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Amazon's S3 buckets for image storage.`
